## 510-27BC - Roman Italy

Nobles are represented in the Senate and commoners in the Assembly and governmental power is divided between them. The extent of the empire abroad, and conflict at home, leads to the decline of democracy in favour of strong dictators.

## 1215 - England

Nobles force King John to sign the Magna Carta establishing written law as a higher power than the rights of the king. The transfer of some power from the king to the nobles introduces basic freedom and property rights to "free men".


## 1295 - England

Edward I adopts the idea of an elected body or "Model Parliament". It includes clergy and aristocracy, as well as representatives of boroughs and counties. A similar system was used by Simon de Montfort - but Edward is the first king to call a parliament.

## 1642-51 - England

Charles I attempts to arrest five MPs sparking a war between parliamentary and Royalist supporters. In 1649 Charles is beheaded and England becomes first a commonwealth and then a protectorate under Oliver Cromwell from 1653. The monarchy is restored in 1660.

## 1679 - England

Habeas Corpus Act is passed which enshrines in law the rights of the individual to legally challenge their imprisonment by the authorities.

## 1689 - England

The Bill of Rights legally establishes the civil and political rights that an English citizen living within a constitutional monarchy ought to have. The Tory faction, later the Conservatives, emerges in this period, heralding the birth of the party system.

## 1775 - American Revolution

In July 1776, the 13 American colonies declare independence from Great Britain and establish the United States of America. The revolutionaries are inspired by republican ideals of equality, liberty and people’s right to govern themselves. A peace treaty in 1783 ends the war with Britain and recognises the sovereignty of the United States.

## 1787 - US

The US constitution, arguably the oldest written democratic constitution, establishes a federal system of government. Separating the powers, of president, Congress and judiciary is intended to stop the abuse of power. Slaves and women cannot vote.

## 1787 - New South Wales

The British Government selects Captain Arthur Phillip to establish a new British colony, to become known as New South Wales. His first Commission is signed on 12 October 1786. A second Commission issued in April 1787 appoints Captain Phillip as Captain-General and Commander-in-Chief of the First Fleet, and a third Commission, dated 24 April 1787, provides him with details concerning the limits of the new colony and sets out his general tasks.

## 1789-99 - France

French Revolution, a period of political upheaval which sees the removal of King Louis XVI who is later executed. Power is transferred from an absolute monarchy to a republic based on citizenship and the rights of the people, although women cannot vote.

## 1791 - Europe’s first democratic constitution

The Polish Constitution of 3 May under King Stanislaw August is Europe’s first democratic codified constitution creating a constitutional monarchy. It introduces political equality between townsfolk and nobility, and places peasants under government protection. It is influenced by the British and American experience.

## 1823 - NSW legislative council

The Charter of Justice 13 October 1823 (UK) establishes a system of justice for Van Diemen’s Land and provides for the appointment of John Lewes Pedder to preside over it as Chief Justice. The New South Wales Act 1823 (UK) authorises the establishment of a legislative council in New South Wales and Australia’s first supreme courts in New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land, as well as providing for Van Diemen’s Land to become a separate colony. The Legislative Council conducts its first meeting in August 1824. These new laws follow criticisms of the administration and justice system in New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land by Commissioner John Thomas Bigge.

## 1830 - Demands for representative government

At a public meeting in Sydney, colonists demand a government whereby the elected representatives of the colony are accountable to parliament and ultimately to the people. This a first step towards colonial independence from British authority.

## 1832 - First Reform Act in England

The House of Commons overwhelmingly represents landed gentry until 1832, when the Reform Act expands the electorate to 700,000 and enfranchises big manufacturing cities. Urban middle-class men mostly win the vote but, until the electoral rolls grow to about 2 million in 1867, they exclude working-class men. Further reform in 1884 extends suffrage to more than 5 million, but women and 40 per cent of men are still voteless.

## 1840 - First elected town councils

The first city council is established in Adelaide, followed by Sydney in 1842. Men must own property worth more than £1000 to stand for election, and wealthy landowners have up to four votes each.

## 1843 - First parliamentary election

Voting begins in the first election for the NSW Legislative Council. Created by the New South Wales Constitution Act 1842 (UK), the Council is Australia’s first semi-representative legislature and lays the groundwork for the parliamentary system. It does not grant full responsible government, but it enables the first election to be held for the two-thirds elected NSW Legislative Council. Ex-convicts are eligible to vote and stand.


## 1847 - Swiss Referendum

A brief civil war leads to a national referendum, one of the first recorded uses in modern history, on a new federal constitution. Switzerland still holds more referendums than any other country.

## 1856 - Australia

The Australian colonies become self-governing — all adult (21 years and over) male British subjects are entitled to vote in South Australia from 1856, in Victoria from 1857, New South Wales from 1858, and Tasmania from 1896. This includes Indigenous men, although they are not encouraged to enrol. Queensland and Western Australia introduce responsible government in 1890 but deny Indigenous people the vote.

Victoria is the first Australian colony to pass a law adopting the secret ballot, a system already successfully used in France and some American states. It involves people voting at elections by casting their vote on paper and putting it in a ballot box, rather than voting by a public show of hands. Voting by ballot has a long history. It was a key element in the British Chartist Movement of the 1830s along with one person one vote, manhood suffrage, equal representation of electoral districts and annual elections. The secret ballot is used in the Victorian elections for the Legislative Assembly in September–October 1856, and is also adopted by Tasmania and South Australia in the same year. It remains a controversial issue in Britain, with advocates seeing it as a way of promoting democracy while opponents fear it will lead to fraud or, at worst, undermine the need for a man to publicly defend his political choice.

## 1858- Australian ballot

The secret ballot, first used in Victoria’s Legislative Assembly elections and adopted by Tasmania and South Australia in 1856, evolves into the ‘Australian ballot’ by 1858. This innovative version of the secret ballot features the distribution of government-printed official ballot slips by electoral officials, ensuring absolute secrecy of people’s voting preferences and limiting the opportunity for corruption. The Australian ballot is a form of the secret ballot and its features are subsequently adopted by many other countries. It remains an important element of the Australian electoral system today.


## 1867 - Britain

Second Reform Act virtually doubles the size of the electorate by increasing the number of men who can vote. All male householders are given the right to vote and lodgers paying Â£10 a year rent.

## 1892 - Preferential voting

Queensland is the first state to introduce preferential voting, a system later adopted by other states and the federal parliament in 1918.


## 1893 - New Zealand

Reputedly one of the first countries to achieve universal suffrage for women. But women did not achieve the right to stand for parliament until 1919 for the lower house and 1941 for the upper house. The first women politicians are, in fact, elected in 1933.

## 1906 - Finland

Women achieve the right to vote and to stand for election. Suffragettes in Britain adopt disruptive tactics in their bid for enfranchisement. Women's work in World War I munitions factories proves a turning point and in 1918 women over 30 gain the vote.

## 1917 - Russia

A series of social and political upheavals leads to the overthrow of the Tsarist autocracy. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, seize power in the October Revolution and establish the world's first communist government ushering in totalitarian rule for the next seven decades.

## 1933 - Germany

Adolf Hitler becomes chancellor after Reichstag elections. His Nazi party passes the Enabling Bill giving him absolute power and Germany becomes a one-party state. The triumph of fascism and communism leads to a dark age for democracy in many European countries.

## 1947 - India

Indian independence marks the beginning of the end of the British Empire as anti-colonial nationalist movements challenge the imperialist power. Three years later India becomes a republic and the largest democracy in the world.

## 1948 - South Africa

Apartheid is a system of racial segregation in South Africa developed by Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd, where blacks are disenfranchised in "white" South Africa and only allowed to vote in the homelands, which are very poor economically.

## 1949 - China

Chiang Kai-shek resigns as president after steadily losing ground to the Communists and Mao Zedong's million-strong Red Army. He flees to Taiwan. Mao establishes the People's Republic of China, which is ruled by the Communist party to this day.

## 1955-68 - US

Combining civil disobedience with direct legal action, the African-American Civil Rights Movement reverses 19th century racist legislation and denial of votes in many southern states. The Montgomery bus boycott, led by Martin Luther King, proves a turning point.

## 1956 - Hungary
Soviet tanks crush pro-democracy protests. More than 3,000 are killed in the violence and hundreds of thousands flee.

## 1957 - Africa

The end of British Empire in Africa begins with Ghana's independence. Like many of the newly-established democracies, it becomes a socialist autocracy. Many French colonies also gain independence, including Algeria in 1962 where Ben Bella is elected in an uncontested ballot.

## 1968 - Czechoslovakia

The "Prague Spring" of political reforms is crushed by Soviet tanks. Dozens are killed and many thousands flee the country which remains under Soviet control until 1989.

## 1970 - Chile

Salvador Allende of Chile becomes the first democratically elected Marxist president and begins an extensive programme of nationalisation and radical social reform. Three years later he is overthrown and dies in a military coup. General Augusto Pinochet replaces him.

## USSR

Mikhail Gorbachev becomes Soviet leader, and launches "perestroika" (reconstruction) reforms, but living standards plummet. In 1991, as some Soviet republics push for independence, hardliners stage a coup. It fails, the Soviet Union disintegrates and Gorbachev is swept aside by Boris Yeltsin.

## 1989 - China

Pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square are brutally suppressed by the authorities. Hundreds, possibly thousands, were killed by the army. While the Communist party remains in control, far-reaching economic reforms are introduced by Deng Xiaoping.

## 1989 - Germany

Hungary opens its border with Austria, allowing thousands of East Germans to escape to the West. After the Berlin Wall falls, largely-peaceful demonstrations in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania lead to the dismantling of one-party systems.

## 1990 - Poland

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa becomes the first democratically-elected president, marking the end of Soviet control. The Solidarity party won parliamentary elections in 1989.

The Dayton Accord sets Bosnia on the road to independent statehood after a bloody civil war. Six independent countries have emerged out of the ruins of Yugoslavia, with Slovenia and Croatia the first to declare their independence in 1991.

## 1999 - Qatar

Qatar becomes first Gulf state to allow women to vote and stand for election. Bahrain and Kuwait have since followed suit.

## 2000 - Mexico

Vicente Fox of the National Action Party (PAN) wins the presidential elections, ending 71 years of one-party rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).

## 2004 - Afghanistan

After the overthrow of the Taleban, Mohammed Karzai becomes the country's first directly elected president. Parliamentary and provincial elections take place in 2005, for the first time in more than 30 years.
