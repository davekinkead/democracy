# A mostly incomplete history of Democracy

Democracy is many different things to many different people.  From an idea that etymologically is simple _the rule of the people_, democracy has become associated with a vast array of sometimes conflicting ideals and procedures - equality and liberty, representation and participation, the rule of law and autonomy, utopian and realist.

This aim of this project is to document the history of two fundamental political themes - actual democracies and democratic theories.  With these histories surveyed, my hope is that I can start making some sense of what it means to be _democratic_.
